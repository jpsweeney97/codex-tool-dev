## 1.0.0 - 2026-09-02

### Added

- Initial packaging of nine in-production spec-to-execution skills (`to-prd`, `to-issues`, `acceptance-map`, `implementation-planning`, `execute-plan`, `implement-issue`, `triage`, `plan-queue`, `spec-drift-reconcile`) as one coherent dual-runtime plugin, per the 2026-09-02 plugin-bundle assessment (`docs/plans/2026-09-02-plugin-bundle-candidates.md` in the source repo) and its cross-model deliberation certificate. Version 1.0.0 reflects established skills, not new ones; no skill body changed in the move. `triage` ships its two companion files (`AGENT-BRIEF.md`, `OUT-OF-SCOPE.md`) and `acceptance-map` its `agents/openai.yaml`; the protected-set drift check in the source repo now reads `acceptance-map` at its plugin path. Built second, after `relay`, in the settled order.
